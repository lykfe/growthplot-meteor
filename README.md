# growthplot-meteor

Iteration of the original Growthplot application that now uses meteor-react.

To get started in your terminal enter the following command from the root of your repo directory:

`cd growthplot && meteor`

A server will spin up automatically and you begin working right away. Simply naviagate to `http://localhost:3000` and the app will display there. The server will watch for any changes you make and as you save, the browser will automatically update.
